Shift Work
----------
Write a function that determines which work shift is working at a given time.
The shifts are defined as:
        Morning (0600 - 1200)
        Daytime (1200 - 1800)
        Evening (1800 - 0000)
        Overnight (0000 - 0600)
ï»¿If there is overlap (i.e. 0800, 1600, and 0000),
return the shift that has worked least (0800 is "Daytime").
